# Cloud in general

Convenient, on-demand network access to shared pool of configurable computing resources and services. Pay as you go pricing is usually available, but not necessary.

Characteristics:

-   on demand self-service
-   accessible over network
-   resource pooling
-   rapid elasticity, resources can quickly scale according to needs
-   measured service, resource usage is metered

Deployment models:

-   Private Cloud, used by a single organization, can be operated by third party
-   Community Cloud, rare, example: folding@home, blockchain
-   Public Cloud, open use by the general public, can be restricted in cases like compliance, example: AWS Gov Cloud
-   Hybrid Cloud, composition of two or more of the previous cloud types, multi-cloud is a subcategory for companies that want to avoid being locked in or companies that want to mix services from various cloud vendors

Benefits of Private Cloud:

-   control
-   cost, very rare, usually it is more expensive
-   security, no shared resources with other potentially malicious actors, more theoretical than real

Benefits of Public Cloud:

-   infinite scalability and flexibility
-   no upfront Capital Expenses
-   global data centers

Benefits of Hybrid Cloud:

-   can save on resources that are more expensive on public clouds
-   can have regulated workloads on Private Cloud

General benefits:

-   Shifts CapEx to OpEx, more preferable to businesses, because it does not tie down financial resources
-   pay as you go
-   agility, no need to wait for new hardware, usage can be scaled with demand
-   experimentation, ideas can be tested without long term commitment
-   security
-   global reach
-   economy of scale
-   no need to pre-plan resource sizing
-   no need to over-provision

Cloud service models:

-   IaaS, no need to manage the physical infrastructure or hardware
-   PaaS, no need to manage the runtime, operating system or infrastructure
-   SaaS, complete product that is managed by the service provider

Responsibilities:

-   On premises: physical, virtualization, guest os, runtime, data, application
-   IaaS: ~~physical~~, ~~virtualization~~, guest os, runtime, data, application
-   PaaS: ~~physical~~, ~~virtualization~~, ~~guest os~~, runtime, data, application
-   SaaS: ~~physical~~, ~~virtualization~~, ~~guest os~~, ~~runtime~~, ~~data~~, ~~application~~

Lines can be blurred with things like containers.
