# About me

I’m a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in DevOps and cloud technologies. Adaptability is one of my core strengths—I shape my approach to suit the specific demands of each project.

For me, quality, correctness, and performance aren’t just nice-to-haves; they’re the essentials that I bring to every line of code. I’m proactive and inquisitive, always digging deeper to find the best solution and to understand how it fits into the broader system.

Over the years, I’ve led projects that span several years, standing by the work and supporting its evolution. My journey has taken me through investment banks and small startups, giving me a well-rounded perspective on software development.

Above all, clear and concise communication is key for me—whether it’s in code, conversation, or documentation.
